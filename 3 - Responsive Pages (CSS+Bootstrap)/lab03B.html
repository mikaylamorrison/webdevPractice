					<h3>Geography and Environment</h3>
					<p>
						Syria is located in the Middle East. Bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to 
						the West, it shares its borders with several countries, including: 
						Turkey to the North, Iraq to the East, Jordan to the South, and Israel 
						and Lebanon to the Southwest.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Covering more than half of the country, the Syrian Desert is a significant 
						geographical feature that extends into neighboring Middle Eastern countries. 
						The Euphrates is the longest river in Western Asia, flowing from Turkey 
						through Syria. A notable feature of the river is the construction of a large 
						dam in north-central Syria, which created Lake Assad, the largest lake in 
						the country.

					<h3>Wildlife</h3>
					<p>
						Syria is home to various carnivorous species, with brown bears 
						and gray wolves being the largest remaining predators in the 
						region. The Syrian landscape also supports striped hyenas, red 
						foxes, caracals, and golden jackals, although sightings of these 
						animals are becoming increasingly rare.In the arid desert regions, 
						one can find sand cats, golden hamsters, and venomous black 
						desert cobras, well-adapted to the harsh environment. Syria’s 
						mountainous areas host an array of birds of prey, including 
						bearded vultures, red kites, and white-tailed eagles.
					</p>

				<section id="Ethnic Groups">
					<h3>Ethnic Groups</h3>
					<p>
						The majority of Syria's population is Arab, with roots tracing back 
						to the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding territories. Minority groups include:
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Kurds</dt>
						<dd>
							Primarily residing in northeast Syria, the Kurdish population forms a 
							distinct ethnic group with a rich cultural heritage.
						</dd>
						<dt>Bedouins</dt>
						<dd>
							These nomadic animal herders travel across North Africa and 
							the Middle East, contributing to the region's diverse cultural tapestry.
						</dd>
					</dl>
				</section>
					
				<section id="Religions">
					<h3>Religions</h3>
					<p>
						Islam is the predominant religion in Syria, with most Syrians practicing the 
						faith. There are also communities of Christians and a smaller Druze population, 
						which follows a unique belief system incorporating elements from Islam, 
						Christianity, and Judaism.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="Culture">
					<h3>Culture</h3>
					<p>
						Damascus, the capital of Syria, holds significant cultural and religious 
						importance as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. 
						It is considered a holy city in Islam and features rich historical and 
						architectural heritage.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						While Syria does not have an official national flower, jasmine is 
						widely cherished. Damascus is affectionately known as "Madinat al-Yasmin," or 
						the "City of Jasmine," reflecting the cultural significance of this 
						fragrant flower.

					<h3>Government</h3>
					<p>
						Syria operates under a presidential system, where the president serves as 
						the head of state and leads the executive branch. The president is elected 
						seven years by popular vote from Syrian citizens, although the electoral 
						process has been criticized for lacking transparency.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Despite being classified as a presidential republic, Syria is regarded as 
						highly authoritarian. Power is concentrated in the hands of a single 
						individual or group. The al-Assad family has been at the helm since 1971, 
						with Bashar al-Assad assuming the presidency in 2000 after his father, 
						Hafez al-Assad, ruled for 30 years. This concentration of power has led 
						to ongoing political strife and unrest within the country.
