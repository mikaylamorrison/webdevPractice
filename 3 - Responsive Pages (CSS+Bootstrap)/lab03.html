				<h3>Intro</h3>
				<p>For this lab, I was required to create responsive pages using CSS and Bootstrap. 
				According to the lab documentation, the theme for my website was based on the last 
				two digits of my student number (58): Syria. It is a beautiful country known for its 
				cultural heritage and long-standing traditions. Here is a brief overview of my 
				experiences with both platforms and responsive design.</p>
				
				<h3>CSS</h3>
				<p>I won’t lie; I didn’t particularly like responsive CSS. While I appreciate how easy 
				it was to customize individual elements (e.g., color, size, justification), I found it 
				very difficult to make the page responsive while maintaining the styling of all 
				elements—especially when it came to images. Although I was able to make my text 
				and grids responsive, the images inside the grids posed a problem on larger screens. 
				They did not enlarge as much as I had intended. Also, columns were not a good experiience for me...
				Additionally, I had difficult centering the images, which made the elements seem rather off-kilter on larger screens. 
				However, the page responded very well on mobile devices and tablets!</p>
				
				<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
				<p>I preferred Bootstrap much more than CSS. Since Bootstrap has its own built-in 
				libraries and styles, it was much easier to make the page responsive; all I had to do was assign 
				a pre-existing class. Bootstrap also allowed me to maintain the element styles that I 
				had defined in my CSS file. The images were a little larger than I expected, but they 
				scaled well across various screen widths and remained centered. Columns worked much better in 
				Bootstrap than in CSS, which helped me to organize my page entirely without grids. Implementing Bootstrap 
				only took me about 30 minutes once I had read the documentation on the site, making it a 
				relatively simple tool to learn!</p>
				
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>Overall, I found the implementation of responsive CSS to be quite challenging, as 
				much tinkering was required to get the page to match my vision. In comparison, Bootstrap 
				was much easier to implement and allowed the elements to scale much better than I had 
				anticipated.</p>
