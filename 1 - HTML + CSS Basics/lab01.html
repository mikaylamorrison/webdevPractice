				Hello! My name is Mikayla, and I’m a third year Computer 
				Science student at TMU. This webpage is a part of my
				first lab for this course, BUT, since this is an autobiographical 
				web page, I am using this opportunity to yap about myself 
				in hopes that you’ll feel like you know me as something 
				more than just a name and student number. Happy reading!!

		Early Life </h3>
		
		<p style="text-align:left; color:#4F6D7A; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">
		I was born on May 10, 2024 in Richmond Hill to parents Sonia 
		and Greg Morrison. I have two younger sisters 
		named Elaina (18) and Natasha (16), so women definitely run 
		our house (as it should be). </p>

		I lived in Penang, Malaysia with my family between the ages of 5 and 7. 
		While there, I attended Dalat International School. It was 
		a time in my life that I look back on with much fondness: I 
		had a lot of friends whose families and was able to experience 
		an incredibly rich culture through night markets, festivals, and cuisine. 
		The funny part is that almost everyone I knew while I was 
		there has since moved back to their home country just like we did, haha. </p>

		Penang, Malaysia?</h4>
		
		<p style="text-align:left; color:#166088; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 60px 0px 60px">
		Penang is a state in Malaysia. It's a on the North-West coast of the country, just below Thailand.
		Penang consist of a portion on the mainland, and an island; we lived on the island!
		While I can go on for hours about the bugs, the heat, its modernity, and 
		the incredible beauty of its greenspaces, one of the things that I remember most 
		was its incredibly diverse population; going to the market, you'd hear all sorts of languages: 
		Mandarin, Cantonese, Malay, English, Tamiil. Given how diverse it is, there was always some sort of celebration 
		going on, which made for a really amazing cultural experience. We got lots of gifts from neighbours haha. 
		Anyways, it's a very very cool place and I hope to visit again some day!  </p>

		Education </h3>	
		
		<p style="text-align:left; color:#4F6D7A; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px"x>
		I went to Northwood Public School in Brampton for elementary school, and while 
		not much happened there (besides me being cast as the main character 
		in the “Horton Hears a Who” musical at our school), I had the privilege 
		of being taught by an amazing teacher named Mrs. Castellarin who was 
		quite literally changed my life. Not only was she so much fun to be 
		around, but she believed in me so much that I never doubted for a second 
		that she could do whatever I set my hand to. Of course, life has presented 
		me with much to doubt, but I will always be grateful to her for helping me 
		find confidence in my ability to learn.</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:left; color:#4F6D7A; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">
		I went to Beatty Fleming Sr. Public School (also in Brampton) for middle school. While 
		I was mostly just your stereotypical Christian girl who was very 
		studious, BUT THE KIDS IN MY YEAR WERE CRAAAAAZZZZYYYY. Thank goodness 
		I avoided the drama by being a part of the French Extended Program. 
		When I was in 7th grade, I had a teacher named Madame Ligonde who 
		constantly challenged me to stretch beyond what was required of me. 
		She taught me to never stop looking for the answer to something that 
		I thought I would never be able to understand. She taught me to not be 
		afraid of the unknown, but to instead embrace it and harness the endless 
		expanse of knowledge that I could acquire by having the audacity to look 
		beyond just what I was instructed to draw my attention to. </p>

		I went to Turner Fenton Secondary High School in Brampton, Ontario. 
		I was a part of the I.B. program, so I have an I.B. Diploma in addition 
		to a standard high school diploma. That program was absolutely wild, and 
		I wouldn’t recommend it to any who isn’t extremely disciplined and super
		passionate about learning, but it was a very valuable experience. I learned 
		how much I love History, Literature, and Biology. MM MM MM, it still excites 
		me to think about it…I have no idea how on earth I wound up in Computer Science, 
		but hey, I won’t question it. Huge shoutout to my HL History teacher Mr. 
		Gervais. Thank you for listening to every single one of my ideas and 
		teaching me how to filter my thoughts to create essays that weren’t just 
		coherent, but impactful. Thank you for believing in my ability to not just 
		be a good student, but to be an advocate for the relevance of history 
		and my place in it. </p>

		As you can tell, I have had the privilege of being taught by amazing
		teachers who absolutely changed my life. <mark style="background: #C1E0F7!important"> They believed in

		Career </h3>
		
		<p style="text-align:left; color:#4F6D7A; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">
		I worked as an I.T. Support Technician at Husky Technologies in 
		the summer of 2022, 2023, 2024. I was mostly troubleshooting with 
		hardware and Microsoft software, as well as playing around with OS 
		and various types of device configuration. As far as soft skills go, 
		I learned a lot…especially about being both sympathetic towards 
		frustrated individuals, and assertive with those who tried to 
		abuse their power. In short, it was a fun and very interesting experience, 
		but definitely NOT something I’d want to do for a living. I hope to dive a little more into a career focus on Enterprise Architecture in the future.</p>

		Personal Life </h3>

		I’m not going to trauma-dump or lament the fact that I don’t have 
		a significant other…So instead I’m gonna tell you about my hobbies 
		and best friends woohoo! Also worth noting, I am Christian. 
		And to be honest, thank goodness for God (haha the irony), because 
		without something to believe in, I’d have given up on life a long time 
		ago. My faith is my light in the dark, and for that I am forever grateful.</p>

					I’ve made coasters, anthropomorphic rabbits (plus clothes

				  <dd style="text-align:left; color:#4F6D7A; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">
					I love to make keychains and bracelets for my friends. 
				  Hearing the beads click against each other is soooo satisfying. 
				  I also had a bracelet business in highschool haha; it went strong 
				  for about 2 years and then I just got frustrated with that fact I 
				  couldn’t make it expand. Great experience though!</dd>

				<dd style="text-align:left; color:#4F6D7A; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">UV cure gel nail polish is better than air dry. I got

		My best friends have shaped me in ways that I am so incredibly grateful 
		for. Particularly my two best friends from highschool. I won’t add 
		their names here, but these two girls are always on my mind, always 
		in my heart, and everything I do reminds me of them. From sobbing over 
		the same set of exams, to fangirling over the same musicians and watching 
		the same movies, my best friends have been there to ride the highs 
		with me and bring me back down to earth. I am so grateful to know t
		hem the way that I do, and everyday I am reminded of how precious they are.</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:left; color:#4F6D7A; font-family:Garamond; padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">
		MY BESTIES IN UNIVERSITY ARE SO FUNNY.  Their names will also not 
		be mentioned, but they just get me. Everytime we’re around each other, 
		we just yap for hours about absolutely everything under the sun. There 
		is never a dull moment with them, and I am so grateful to be surrounded 
		by friends who aren’t just smart, funny, and relatable, but who are 
		genuinely good people with great passion for everything they do. I 
		hope to be more like them in the future.</p>
